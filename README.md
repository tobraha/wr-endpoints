# wr-endpoints

As an MSP managing numerous clients with the Webroot GSM Global Console,
there is no easy way to see the policies that endpoints are assigned to 
at the global level.  It can only be done by site, which is tedious.
Perhaps there is some other way to get this info from the web portal,
but I threw this together to generate a spreadsheet of all endpoints 
and the policies they're assigned to.

Simply run webroot.py and enter the GSM console login credentials and 
API credentials when prompted.  There's some error checking, but 
it's not perfect I'm sure.
